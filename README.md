# 🧠 Simple XOR Neural Network  

## 👨‍💻 About the Creator  
This project was developed by **Jumayna AbdelHay Ghida**, an **AI student at Delta University**, **Student ID: [4221107]**.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **simple neural network** in Python to solve the **XOR problem**, a fundamental task in neural networks. The network is built **from scratch** without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  

## 📌 Why is this Code Important?  
The XOR problem is a classic example demonstrating the necessity of **non-linearity** in neural networks. A single-layer perceptron cannot solve XOR because it is not linearly separable. This project implements a **basic feedforward neural network with one hidden layer**, trained using **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**.  

## 🔹 Key Features  
✅ **Fully custom neural network** (no external frameworks).  
✅ **Backpropagation and gradient descent** for learning.  
✅ **Sigmoid activation function** for non-linearity.  
✅ **Basic implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).**
